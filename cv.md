### Profile
I've been working as a mechanical engineer since I graduated from university in 2019.
But despite the experience gained over these 3 years, I realized that I am interested in a more relevant profession, where the possibility of growth depends only on skills, not on time spend in this position and place of education.
The projects which I worked with dragged on for too long, you can wait for their launch for years, while completed work is losing it's relevance.
I managed to work both in the office and with a remote team, methodically and responsibly performing the tasks of creating models and assemblies, documentation, writing manuals, meeting with customers and manufacturers. At the same time, front-end development is working on demanding and relevant tasks, the result of which can be assessed almost instantly.
Also, remote work is more often available for developers than for mechanical engineers, which is quite relevant at the present time.

I hope that my desire to constantly learn new things, as well as the desire to change my life, will help me master a new relevant profession and realize myself professionally.

### Code Example
*Your goal in this kata is to implement a difference function, which subtracts one list from another and returns the result. It should remove all values from list `a`, which are present in list `b` keeping their order.*
```
function arrayDiff(a, b) {
  const aPrew = a;
  b.forEach(bnum => {
  a = a.filter(num => num != bnum)
  });
  return a;
}
```
